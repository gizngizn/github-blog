From [WHO](https://www.who.int/news/item/29-10-2024-tuberculosis-resurges-as-top-infectious-disease-killer):

> The World Health Organization (WHO) today published a new report on tuberculosis revealing that approximately 8.2 million people were newly diagnosed with TB in 2023 – the highest number recorded since WHO began global TB monitoring in 1995. This represents a notable increase from 7.5 million reported in 2022, placing TB again as the leading infectious disease killer in 2023, surpassing COVID-19

COVID-19 has dethroned TB as the infectious disease causing most deaths worldwide recently, but a new report from WHO puts TB back on top.

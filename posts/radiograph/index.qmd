From [Small Things Considered](https://schaechter.asmblog.org/schaechter/2013/03/pictures-considered-the-e-coli-chromosome-caught-in-the-act-of-replicating.html):

> We continue our series of images that have made a difference in microbiology. This one, published by John Cairns in 1963 has earned a most deserved place in textbooks and re­views. It shows a radioautograph of an intact E. coli chromosome in the act of repli­cat­ing. From this image, Cairns concluded that the E. coli chromosome is: i) a single piece of double stranded DNA, 700−900 μm long, and ii) circular.

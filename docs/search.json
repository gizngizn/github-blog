This represents a notable increase from 7.5 million reported in 2022, placing TB again as the leading infectious disease killer in 2023, surpassing COVID-19\n\nCOVID-19 has dethroned TB as the infectious disease causing most deaths worldwide recently, but a new report from WHO puts TB back on top.\n/g\n\n1 + 2 + 3\n\n[1] 6\n\n\nUPDATE: Please also see this post."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Invasive pneumococcal disease is a life-threatening condition caused by Streptococcus pneumoniae. Not all S. pneumoniae strains are equally prone to cause severe disease, and therefore, vaccinations target the most pathogenic serotypes of the bacterium.\nFrom UpToDate:\n&gt; A single nasopharyngeal culture shows about 20 to 25 percent of children in the United States to be colonized; with repeated sampling, the prevalence rises to 30 to 40 percent and, in daycare settings, it exceeds 50 percent [3]. On any single occasion, about 5 to 10 percent of adults are colonized; these rates have not changed substantially since introduction of the conjugate polysaccharide pneumococcal vaccine\nPneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCV) consist of pneumococcal capsular polysaccharides conjugated to a protein. They are named with numbers indicating the number of pneumococcal capsule types included in the vaccine. For example, PCV20 provides protection against 20 serotypes.\nIn Sweden, PCV7 was introduced into the national vaccination program for children in 2009. In 2010, some regions introduced PCV10, while others used PCV13. The following graph shows how the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease fell across all age groups.\n\nIn 2019, public procurement made PCV10 the standard for all regions, and as shown above, the incidence rose substantially after that.\nWhile some of this rise might be explained by a post-COVID increase in airway pathogens, data shows that most invasive cases are caused by serotypes not included in PCV13 or PCV15, as indicated by the purple section in the graph below.\n\nSince September 2023, all Swedish children are offered PCV15. It will be interesting to see how this affects the incidence in the coming year.\n/g"

This one, published by John Cairns in 1963 has earned a most deserved place in textbooks and re­views. It shows a radioautograph of an intact E. coli chromosome in the act of repli­cat­ing.

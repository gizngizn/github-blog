    "text": "From Small Things Considered:\n\nWe continue our series of images that have made a difference in microbiology. This one, published by John Cairns in 1963 has earned a most deserved place in textbooks and re­views. It shows a radioautograph of an intact E. coli chromosome in the act of repli­cat­ing. From this image, Cairns concluded that the E. coli chromosome is: i) a single piece of double stranded DNA, 700−900 μm long, and ii) circular.\n\n/g\n\n\n\nCitationBibTeX citation:@online{2024,\n  author = {, gizn},\n  title = {A 1963 Radioautograph of an {E.} Coli Chromosome},\n  date = {2024-10-09},\n  url = {https://gizn.org/posts/here-goed-the-slug/},\n  langid = {en}\n}\nFor attribution, please cite this work as:\ngizn. 2024. “A 1963 Radioautograph of an E.
